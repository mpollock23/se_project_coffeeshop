# Triple Peaks Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

This is a responsive website for a coffee shop that features:
- A menu of coffee drinks, espresso options, and baked goods with prices
- An online reservation system for table booking
- Embedded video recipes for coffee brewing methods
- Information about the coffee shop's mission and values
- Hours of operation and location details

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

Options for improvement include:
- Adding a link from each baked good item in the menu that leads to a section detailing the ingredients and nutritional value of that item
- Adding an option for customers to leave reviews and rate the coffee shop
- Adding contact information (phone number, email address, etc.)
- Adding an option for customers to pre-order online
